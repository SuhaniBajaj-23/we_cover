We Care, We Cover, as our tagline implies.
In India, we want to achieve basic living standards. Where there is no one who lacks fundamental living necessities, as well as promoting small businesses by providing them with the publicity and resources they require.

## Our Working
 - The user will be asked to sign up as Donor or Availer.
 - If the person chooses to donate he will be redirected to a page where he can specify the type of clothing and size of cloth he wants to donate. After making a successful donation the person will be given some credits which can be exchanged for coupons from local businesses.
 - If the person/organisation Signs Up as an availer he will be provided with choices of clothes available which the person/organisation can easily buy.
 - The availer will be verifying being delivered with the cloth using blockchain themself ensuring the cloth actually reaches the needy.
 - Donators will earn rewards for each successful donation which they can later redeem as coupons for shopping at local businesses.
 - For assigning the rewards to a particular Clothing we are using an ML model which takes the image uploaded by the donar and identifies the type of clothing and assign rewards equally to maintain transparency.
 - Local businesses will also be able to reach a bigger set of audience and advertise using our platform
